# Default permission for all commands
# You can change the permission for each command in the command's yaml file
# The permission is a string, it can be:
# - "everyone": everyone can use the command
# - "owner": only the bot owner can use the command
# - "admin": only the server admins (with discord's administrator permission) can use the command
# - "mod": only the server mods (with discord's manage server permission) can use the command
# - "disabled": no one can use the command
# To allow multiple permissions, separate them with a comma. For example: "owner,admin"
